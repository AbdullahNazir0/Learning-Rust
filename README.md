# Rust Daily Practice Repository

Welcome to my Rust Daily Practice Repository! üöÄ

This repository is a collection of my daily Rust coding exercises and practice sessions. As I navigate through the world of Rust programming, I commit code regularly to track my learning journey, experiment with new concepts, and reinforce my understanding of the language.

I started a challenge to learn rust in 25 days. I will also upload my progress report when i will complete the challenge. I am learning from the official book of rust, The Rust Programming Language.

## Structure

- üìÅ **src**: Contains the source code for daily practice exercises.
- üìÑ **README.md**: You're reading it right now! It provides an overview of the repository and serves as a logbook for my Rust learning adventure.

## Why a Daily Practice Repository?

- **Track Progress:** Each commit represents a step forward in my Rust learning journey.
  
- **Experimentation Playground:** I use this space to try out new Rust features, test code snippets, and explore concepts in a hands-on manner.

- **Reference Material:** This repository serves as a reference for myself and others interested in my coding style, problem-solving approach, and lessons learned.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-daily-practice.git`
2. Explore the `src` directory to find daily coding exercises.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for personal practice, I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities. Feel free to open issues or pull requests!

Happy coding! ü¶Ä
